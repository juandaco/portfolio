      Hi I'm David, a self-taught software developer with a year's worth of exerience.
      I learned how to code by working through{' '}
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        freeCodeCamp's
      </a>{' '}
      curriculum, an open source nonprofit community that helps people learning how to develop 
      Full-Stack Web Applications. The alumni solve programming challenges and build a project based
      job-worthy portfolio. I acquired the three{' '}
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/juandaco" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        base certificates
      </a>{' '}
       (Front-End, Data Visualization and Back-End) and I'm currently working on
      the last one by contributing to open source nonprofit projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my journey, I have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery,
      Bootstrap, React, Redux, D3, MongoDB, Express, Node.js and RESTful APIs. I
      also have a pretty good grasp of Python, SQL, Bash Scripting, Version
      Control (Git), Regular Expressions and general Linux knowledge.
      {/* I'm currently working on improving my knowledge of Math, Algorithms and Data
